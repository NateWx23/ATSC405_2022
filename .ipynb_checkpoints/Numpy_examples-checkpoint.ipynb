    "Numpy comes with several easy ways to compute statistics of the data within an array. This is one reason that numpy arrays are preferred over lists and tuples for number crunching. Many of the statistics calculations can be done with the methods from the arrays themselves. Remember that a method is just a function that belongs to a particular object (in this case the array object). Numpy also has many functions for computing statistics from arrays. In general, there is no major difference in which way you do it, but there are more options with the numpy functions. Some examples are given below using both ways. An important key here is the use of the **axis** argument to specify how to calculate the statistics. <br> Below uses the max method/function to find the max value for the array."
